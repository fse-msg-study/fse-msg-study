# Revisiting Learning-based Commit Message Generation  

This is the replication package for "Revisiting Learning-based Commit Message Generation". We provide the scripts to reproduce all the results of the paper.

## 1 Preparation

We provide a requirements file `requirements.txt` containing all the packages needed for reproduction. You can run the following commands to create the conda environment and install all the packages.

```shell
$ conda create -n fse-msg-study python=3.8
$ conda activate fse-msg-study
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2 Commit Messages

In this section, we introduce the commit messages used in each RQ.

#### Default Models (RQ1)

In RQ1, the commit messages generated by **the default models** are used and analyzed. For each technique , the commit messages generated by the default model are placed in the file `CommitMessages/DefaultModels/output_modelname_train`  and `CommitMessages/DefaultModels/output_modelname` for the training set and testing set respectively ,  and `modelname`  is one of NMT, PtrGNCMsg, CODISUM, and CoreGen. 

#### Modified Dataset (RQ2)

In RQ2, the commit messages generated by **the models training with various modified datasets** are used and analyzed. For each technique, the commit messages generated by the model training with the dataset which decreases the pattern ratio by ***R*** are placed in the file `CommitMessages/ModifiedDataset/output_modelname_R`, and ***R*** is from 0 to 0.9. For example, the commit messages generated by NMT training with the dataset which decreases the pattern ratio by 20% are placed in `CommitMessages/ModifiedDataset/output_nmt_0.2`.

#### Input Representation (RQ3)

In RQ3,  the commit messages generated by **the models training with various input representations** are used and analyzed. For each technique, the commit messages generated by the model training with mark representation and code representation are placed in the file`CommitMessages/InputRepresentation/output_modelname_onlymark` and `CommitMessages/InputRresentation/output_modelname_onlyword` respectively.

#### Component (RQ4)

In RQ4, the commit messages generated by **the models removing each component** are used and analyzed. For each technique, the commit messages generated by the model removing different components are placed in the file `CommitMessages/Component/output_modelname_noatten`, `CommitMessages/Component/output_modelname_nocopy`, or `CommitMessages/Component/output_modelname_noanony`.

## 3 Patterns

In this section, we introduce the steps to obtain the patterns.  We use the MaxSP [1], a sequential pattern mining algorithm, to mine frequent patterns
from the commit messages generated by each technique.  We use the implementation of MaxSP provided by the data mining library SPMF [2], and the documentation is in this [website](https://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/MaxSP.php).  Switch to the directory `Patterns`, you can execute `get_patterns.sh`  to get the frequent patterns of each technique, which will be saved in `Patterns/results`.

```shell
$ bash get_patterns.sh
```

In this paper, we obtain a total of four patterns, that is, **Addition Pattern**, **Removal Pattern**, **Fix Pattern**, and **Avoidance Pattern**, which is shown in the following table, including pattern name, pattern format, and pattern description.

| Pattern Name      | Pattern Format                  | Pattern Description                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Addition Pattern  | Add [missing] ... [for\|to ...] | New/missing elements are needed      |
| Removal Pattern   | Remove unused\|unnecessary ...  | Code changes have redundant elements |
| Fix Pattern       | Fix ... [in\|when ...]          | Code changes have bugs               |
| Avoidance Pattern | Don't\|do not ... [if ...]      | Some things shouldn't be done        |

The detailed description of each pattern is as follows.

+ **Addition Pattern**. The commit message is used when a new element is added or certain missing element is added. We give a real example of  Addition Pattern in the following image.

  <img src="https://github.com/fse-msg-study/fse-msg-study/blob/main/Examples/example_add.png?raw=true" style="zoom: 33%;" />

+ **Removal Pattern**. The commit message is used when the commit removes redundant elements (e.g., code, imports, and methods) in code changes. We give a real example of  Removal Pattern in the following image.

  <img src="https://github.com/fse-msg-study/fse-msg-study/blob/main/Examples/example_remove.png?raw=true" style="zoom: 33%;" />

+ **Fix Pattern**.  The commit message is used when the commit fixes some bugs. We give a real example of  Fix Pattern in the following image.

  <img src="https://github.com/fse-msg-study/fse-msg-study/blob/main/Examples/example_fix.png?raw=true" style="zoom: 33%;" />

+ **Avoidance Pattern**.  The commit message is used when developers made some mistakes, and the commit message states not to do that and usually uses an adverbial clause to state the circumstance. We give a real example of  Avoidance Pattern in the following image.

## 4 Reproduction 

In this section, we show the scripts and steps to reproduce the results present in the paper. We name the scripts to get the Table ***X***/Figure ***X*** presented in RQ ***Y*** of the paper as  `get_rqY_tableX.py`/`get_rqY_figureX.py`, which is placed in the folder `Scripts`. For example, the Figure 5 is presented in RQ2, so the script to get it is `get_rq2_table5.py`.  Switch to the directory  `Scripts`, you can run each script to get the corresponding table/figure, which will be saved in `Scripts/TablesAndFigures/rqY_tableX.tex` or `Scripts/TablesAndFigures/rqY_figureX.png`.  The table is in the format of *latex*, and can be compiled to *pdf*, and the package *multirow* and *booktabs* are needed for compilation.

```shell
$ python get_rqY_tableX.py
```

or

```shell
$ python get_rqY_figureX.py
```

In addition, we put the commands to execute all the scripts to one single script `run_total.sh`, and you can switch to the directory  `Scripts` and get all the tables/figures of the paper by running

```shell
$ bash run_total.sh
```
